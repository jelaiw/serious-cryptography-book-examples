## Overview
A git repo for working examples from Dr. Aumasson's excellent introductory cryptography book [1].

## View or Run Examples
Click on any of the Jupyter notebooks (i.e., the `.ipynb` files) to view them.

Or interact live with a Jupyter notebook (e.g., re-run cells, change parameters), courtesy of the excellent Binder project [2].

*It can take a minute to spin up JupyterLab on Binder, so be patient.*

NOTE: The Jupyter notebooks run with the SageMath kernel (e.g., Listings 10-1 and 10-2) are view-only for now. There is a conda-based SageMath environment for Binder at https://github.com/sagemath/sage-binder-env, but it usually takes a few tries (and a long wait) for me.
