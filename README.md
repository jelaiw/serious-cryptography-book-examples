## Overview
A git repo for working examples from Jean-Philippe Aumasson's excellent introductory cryptography book [1].

## View or Run Examples
Click on any of the Jupyter notebooks (i.e., the `.ipynb` files) to view them.

Or interact live with a Jupyter notebook (e.g., re-run cells, change parameters), courtesy of the excellent Binder project [2].

NOTE: It usually takes about a minute to spin up JupyterLab on Binder, so be patient.
